So, I have a digital journal (DayOne <http://dayoneapp.com/>, good app)
that I mostly feel guilty about never updating, but I found a few gems
today from the first months I was here:

12/8/2013: “Received an email from Adam Evans at a company called Relate
IQ… never heard of it. It’s down in Palo Alto. Not sure I want to make that
commute, but maybe I can do some contracting work”

1/12/2014: “The team’s too good. I think I’ll have to take this job if they
offer it… I hope they offer it.”

3/27/2014: “Launched the re-skin of RelateIQ around 10:30 pm last night.
For the first time, I really feel like I’m part of this team … I looked
around and felt a pang of nostalgia in the moment. Definitely a good thing.”

4/23/2014: “I’m in a really good place right now. Like, really, really
good.”


Today is my last day at SalesforceIQ and it has been, hands down, the best
job I’ve ever had. Thank you to every last one of you for making it happen.
And keep it up; this place is special. #people #moments #ideas #results
