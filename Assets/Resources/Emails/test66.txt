Hi Team,

On Friday, new printers were delivered and installed.  No action is needed
on your end unless your default printer was the 124U HP Big Boy on the 2nd
Floor as it has been replaced with a Canon MFP.  If you sit on the 2nd
floor at 124U and need to print, you'll need to setup the new printer.

For your reference, the printer setup page
<https://confluence.relateiq.com/display/IKB/Printers> in Confluence has
been updated.  If you have any questions, please let us know.

Thanks,
-IT Team
