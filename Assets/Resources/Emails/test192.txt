Team,

Just wanted to give everyone an update on the Product summit this past
thursday. The audience was Parker Harris, Alex Dayon, Mike Rosenbaum, Srini
T. and product/engg team members across products at Salesforce. The goal is
to highlight progress and share roadmaps for 206, 208, and beyond.

Adam, Steve, David and I shared some of the highlights on Inbox. I've
attached the slides that we walked through - please let me know if you have
any questions!

Highlights -

   - Parker, Alex and Mike excited about all the progress we've made so
   far, and more importantly excited about what's ahead
   - David crushing a Calendar demo, after which Parker announced that he's
   going 100% Inbox (he was particularly pumped about the 1-click conf
   calling!)
   - Adam artfully dodging the question on whether we're going to build a
   full-blown Outlook competitor (tldr - the plan is the plan for now, and
   we're focused on building the world's best productivity tool for sales
   teams)

Coming away from the session, its incredible to see the excitement for
Inbox across Salesforce, and the recognition of everything we've built so
far. Everyone is onboard to help us get to $100m and beyond over the next
year!
