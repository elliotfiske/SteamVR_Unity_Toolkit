Salesforce offers a wide range of perks - make sure to take advantage of
these incredible reimbursements and discounts galore!  Check out this list
as a quick refresher:

AnyPerk

   -

   With AnyPerk <https://anyperk.com/salesforce.com#/>, Salesforce rewards
   employees with a variety of perks --usually upwards of 15% off--on fitness,
   travel, spa, massages, concert tickets, nanny services, house cleaning, etc.
   -

   There is also a chrome extension and if you download it, anytime you are
   on a site with an AnyPerk discount, a pop-up will appear and let you know
   what the discount is!


Wellness Reimbursement

   -

   The Wellness Reimbursement gives you up to $100 a month for fitness
   activities, massages, nutritional counseling, smoking cessation programs,
   and/or weight management programs. Check it out on WageWorks
   <https://www.wageworks.com/>.  The Wellness Reimbursement is
   reimbursable month-by-month and you have 5 months from each passing month
   to submit.


Employee matching gifts program

   -

   Salesforce.org will still match employee donations to any nonprofit
   organization up to $5,000.  You will receive $2,500 at the beginning of the
   fiscal year, and another $2,500 once you reach your 7 days of VTO.  The
   minimum matching grant amount is $50.
