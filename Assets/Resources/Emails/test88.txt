Bob Logan

    • Significant parsing speed improvements for ContactIQ signature
parsing

    • Backlog cut from millions to a few thousand


Marcin Zieminski

    • Testing infrastructure for PredictionIO that can test all the
different configurations

    • Docker container that contains everything you need to test PIO
(spark, postgres, hadoop, ...etc)


Chan Lee

    • Heroku buildpack for PredictionIO

    • Heroku now supports Spark because of this

    • Created a sample app for doing SPAM classification

    • Chan is really gonna miss fraiche


Marco Viviero

    • Took a Salesforce CSV, converted it to Avro; basically salesforce
data is *almost* useful for us


Eli Hickox

    • Administration console for Salesforce Inbox


Ting-Po Lee

    • Image enrichment project -- recommend user-images for users who don't
have images

    • We can recommend over 20k images.  About 2k have images currently set.


Elliot Fiske

    • Fancy new tasks interface in Salesforce Inbox (+undo functionality)


Jon Gretarsson

    • Crypter is now multi-DC!

    • (with zero-downtime by the way)


Danny Dang

    • Live-demo of the new SFIQ CRM E-mail templates functionality (it
looks pretty snazzy)


Robert Ames

    • Improved logging and bug-button for Inbox


Hiro Inami

    • Much MUCH better online/offline status handling in the chrome
extension

    • You get notifications when it can't connect instead of like...
failing quietly


Bob Van Osten

    • Graph (er... I mean Signals) got all kinds of snazzy

    • "Moments" UI shows little markers for stuff like pricing discussions
(and some other stuff I didn't catch)


Jackson Chung

    • BEGIN WORK ON MULTI-DC!!!

    • Thank you Fabian for letting Jackson know what timezone Frankfurt is
in :P


Josh Sauter

    • Demo of our native-outlook testing for the inbox extension (since we
can't use selenium for native apps)

    • He (bravely) went in front of the entire company with a windows
laptop show


Seth Voltz

    • A bunch of significant build improvements for the outlook build


Andy Wang

    • Presenting his intern project: Distributed Tracing!

    • Ability to track our 'messages' across machines (you guys this is a
big deal)

    • We can see how much time a request spends in the web servers vs.
storm vs. whatever else we run


*Honorable Mention* – All this fancy new amazing furniture ("that
one-legged guy that hobbles his way around the office" and the rest of the
workplace services team)
*Helmet* (*except this week it's a fire truck... because reasons.)* – Jón
for taking care of the crypter multi-DC thing in a SUPER smooth release
with 0 downtime.
*Bear* – Josh.  Josh for being an absolute beast (see demo notes).  And
also for having to deal with native outlook.
