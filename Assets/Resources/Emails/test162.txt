Beloved team,

In anticipation of expanding our data center presence across multiple
continents, I will be moving crypter into a partial-read-only mode
<https://github.com/relateiq/crypter-service/pull/114/files#diff-3cc2d8f7173fd0ee89c59af790df87bbR326>
this afternoon, which I expect to last for the duration of the day.  What
this means to you is that if you are hoping to provision new *roles*, or
assign *new permissions* to existing roles, please abstain for the day.  Or
reach out to me directly.

If you would like to follow along, I'll be performing status updates and
plan discussion in #multidc-crypter, which has all of the relevant
documentation pinned to the channel.

Bromide and Salamanders,
