As we continue to align with expenses across the company, we are also
adapting our commuter perks.  Going forward, we will no longer be offering
the Lyft credit perk to SalesforceIQ employees.

For those that selected and enrolled in the Lyft credit program:

   -

   You should have received your last Lyft credits (for the month of
   September) last week.
   -

   Later this month, you will receive a base salary increase of $3,600
   (equivalent to the $300/month in Lyft credits).


For those that commute to our Palo Alto offices 2+ days/week:

   -

   If you do not already have a Palo Alto parking permit, you can still get
   on the waitlist.  Note - There is high demand for these permits and the
   waitlist is expected to take until January 2017.
   -

   To get on the waitlist, please complete the Palo Alto Parking Permit
   survey
   <https://docs.google.com/a/salesforce.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc1uZ0vdsEYGwWco1qFKMy-IDkgTUj2dx-awrBZTNDNGoFXWg/viewform>.



For everyone:

   -

   You can use Salesforceâ€™s commuter benefit program, administered by
   WageWorks <https://www.wageworks.com/>, to set aside up to $255 each
   month in pretax dollars for commuting expenses (bus, train, ferry,
   streetcar, vanpools) and up to $255 for parking expenses.


If you have any questions on this, please reach out to me to clarify!

Best,
Kristen
