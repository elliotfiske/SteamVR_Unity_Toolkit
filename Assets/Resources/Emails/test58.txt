Quip, the next generation of productivity, now available on Aloha SSO

Now that we've welcomed Quip to the #SalesforceOhana, it's a great time to add Quip to your suite of collaboration tools. Quip is Trust-approved and now available on Aloha SSO. 



Here's what you need to know to get going:

Quip is a productivity platform designed for teams

Quip changes the way people work by marrying communication and content to enable collaboration right within your documents, across any device. Quip can be a meeting spot for your team to write, edit, and discuss documents, spreadsheets, and checklists. 


With chat and commenting, you can discuss and make decisions directly in the doc; with the edit feed, you can keep track of changes to documents. Quip helps reduce email, makes you more efficient, and helps your team collaborate faster than other tools like Microsoft Office and Google Docs.

Watch me Quip
Quip is great for collaborating on projects, running 1:1 and team meetings, taking notes for your team, and creating task lists. Additionally, Quip is used to collaborate on team-based spreadsheets and brainstorm and plan with teams, customers, and partners.

Quip is getting better every day...and we need your help to make it better

There are so many ways you can use Quip to change the way you work, but we know that it may not currently fulfill all of your content collaboration needs and you may need to rely on other tools in addition to Quip. We don't recommend that you use Quip for managing documents that need a specific look or feel (margins, font colors) or spreadsheets with more than 10,000 cells. 


We are continuing to develop the product and we're looking for your feedback to help make Quip even better. Post your product feedback and suggestions in the
