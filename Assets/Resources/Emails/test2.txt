App Cloud App of the Week - BMC



Hi Elliot,



IT Trailblazers empower everyone around them with great apps, but how do they do it when they have a big stack of requests, all marked high priority?BMC Software was faced with this familiar obstacle: a bottleneck of high-priority apps meant that its IT team couldn't deliver on all the apps its customers needed. As an IT management solution and software company, BMC knew how important it was to enable everyone in the organization to innovate and improve how they did business.



That's where our Trailblazer, BMC's Senior Director of Solutions Delivery David Riggan, saw an opportunity. A Salesforce customer for eight years, BMC turned to Salesforce App Cloud and Trailhead to teach its staff to build, manage, and deploy their own apps securely and easily. And not just any apps, but great apps their users loved!



Read on to learn how BMC leveraged App Cloud and Trailhead to innovate faster and better than ever before. I actually used to work upstairs from the BMC headquarters in Houston - so it's exciting for me to know it's an office full of Trailblazers!

BMC Software 
Segment: EBU
Industry: High Tech
Location: Houston, TX
Featured App: Rapid App Development platform
Results:Five new citizen-developed apps built in two months and a new automated system to allow anyone in the company to request, build, test, review, and roll out new apps.



The Situation



BMC Software is a global leader in innovative IT management solutions and software. Its 6,000+ employees service 10,000+ customers and over 82% of the Fortune 500. The BMC team makes decisions based upon customer value, exhibiting innovation and agility in everything it does. 



However, the limited resources of BMC's IT team was causing a backlog of important apps that could otherwise be helping the company. The most business-critical apps were prioritized, but additional resources weren't available for a growing list of apps. Eventually, individual business units learned that their apps would never get prioritized and deployed, so they had to use Excel spreadsheets or old systems to get their work done. 



Trailblazer David Riggan - Senior Director of Solutions Delivery at BMC - saw that innovation was being constrained by a lack of developers. Riggan also understood that business users with app needs were uniquely qualified to make those apps, provided they had the right tools and training. BMC had already used Salesforce to manage its customer and prospect relationships, and built mobile apps to modernize its PTO process and executive briefings. What if the same tools and training Riggan's team utilized could empower business analysts to build their own apps?

The App



The Rapid App Development platform allow business users at BMC to build apps that otherwise would simply never be built. Built with both out-of-the-box and custom components, business users are building great apps for their workflow, and IT is managing these apps on the secure Salesforce platform they already trust.



Anyone from BMC can request an app on the Rapid App Development platform, itself an app built on App Cloud. Once approved by someone in IT, a developer sandbox is automatically created and sent to the business user for him or her to start building. With App Cloud's Lightning App Builder, business analysts need little-to-no code to build their apps, and they can use Trailhead to learn and expand their skills on the Salesforce platform.



Once development of the app is complete, it automatically gets sent to IT for review and approval. Once approved, it's automatically available for the business users on both their desktop and mobile devices.

The Results



A small, proactive group of BMC employees took it upon themselves to enroll in the free online training modules on Trailhead. There, they learned how to build low-code and no-code apps on App Cloud, and BMC suddenly had a low-cost way to expand its internal app-development capabilities. The Rapid App Development platform, built on App Cloud, now counts more than 20 members of sales, finance, and other departments as BMC's "citizen developers." In the two months following the launch of the app, five new apps have already been created and deployed by BMC's citizen developers. Business units like the sales operations and finance teams love the ability to build their own apps and automate previously manual processes. Developers are left to focus on more complex apps, and on using code to
 build reusable custom components that business units can use in their apps with just clicks. 



Ultimately, this means the BMC team can keep its customer's needs front and center, and never have to settle for old or suboptimal business processes just to deliver value.

Looking Ahead



BMC has made Salesforce a strategic pillar in its app strategy as the main part of its Rapid App Development platform. BMC is seeing great adoption and new innovation with Trailhead and its Rapid App Development platform.
