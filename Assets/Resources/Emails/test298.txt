Hi Team,

Today is Harshit's last day here with SIQ as an CRM intern. Please join me
to say goodbye and thank Harshit for his great work for the past summer.

Just a quick recap, during this past summer, Harshit contributed to 8
repositories (he init 2 of them) and 168 commits with 2,500 line addition.
Harshit also contributed greatly to our SIQ culture: People/Moments,
Silicon Valley Sports League and most importantly, Meme Tech Talk.
Personally I learned a lot and felt on-trend again. Harshit, best of luck
and hope to see you again soon!
