All,

We had a two part post mortem on the Email Notifications code red from the
previous week. The post mortem notes are in Confluence here
<https://confluence.relateiq.com/display/ENG/Email+Notification+-+2016-08-24>,
and the tasks are created and assigned in JIRA for short term / long term
action items.

Huge thank you to the entire team involved with the issue, *and* those
handling the communications for notifying customers over the next few weeks.

Best,
Annie
