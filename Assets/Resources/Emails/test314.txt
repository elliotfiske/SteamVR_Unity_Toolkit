________________________________

*Problems Solved:*

Address Properties enables customers to customize their workflow in
SalesforceIQ by parsing mailing addresses into separate fields within the
Grid.

For example:

   -

   A salesperson wants to sort all leads in San Francisco in preparation
   for their upcoming business trip there.
   -

   A salesperson wants to filter their contacts by city to create
   geographically personalized mass emails.
   -

   A sales manager wants to see lead penetration by postalcode to assess
   the health of a particular sales territory.


*What’s shipping?*

   -

   Intelligent parsing splits addresses up into city, state/province,
   country, zip/postal code when a full mailing address is detected.
   -

   Typeahead helps to auto-populate addresses using the Google Maps API
   saving time and minimizing error.


*Timing:*

   - Available to employees 8/18
   - Ramping externally end of August, exact date TBD pending bug triage

*Metrics: *

   -

   % Parseable Addresses in SalesforceIQ Database
   -

      Currently only 30% of addresses on contact-based lists and 15% of
      addresses on account-based lists are eligible to be parsed for V1
      -

         The majority of our customers only have partial addresses inputted
         in the 'Address' field today.
         -

         We expect the % of parseable addresses in our system to grow once
         Import V2 ships and it becomes possible to concatenate
address fields from
         an XLS into a single mailing address cell
         -

   Usage Rate
   -

      Goal of 50% of all orgs using address properties by December 2016
      based on Account Property baseline


*Marketing:*

   -

   Blog post coming soon to be released in conjunction with Custom Contact
   Properties launch.


*Support Material:*

   -

   Help Center documentation will be published before external launch and
   shared with next release update.


*Known Issues:*

   -

   Large number of incomplete/partial addresses in the system due to import
   UI and previous lack of parsing ability. Only full mailing addresses
   will be parsed to maintain accuracy; incomplete/partial addresses will not
   be parsed for V1 (See metrics section above)
   -

   Sporadic failures to parse when adding addresses directly to the Grid. (
   https://jira.salesforceiq.com/browse/CRM-16011)
   -

   The app does not parse the address properly when the user has added more
   than 2 contact addresses and there is no primary. (
   https://jira.salesforceiq.com/browse/CRM-12811)
