Yes you can erase, whiteboards shops not be treated as permanent. We all have phones with great cameras so feel free to use them and allow others to use the whiteboard after you. Thanks, Adam On

Hi Team,

Sorry, I forgot to put Subject on my previous email.

IT and Workplace Services has plan to give new look to conference rooms in
117. We will have vendor to repaint the wall, put new glass marker board,
remove projectors, put new TV, and chromebox. We will start repaint the
wall on Friday next week but i saw diagram/graph in Santana with Do Not
Erase sign. (Attached is the picture)

Can we have this erase next week?


Thank You
