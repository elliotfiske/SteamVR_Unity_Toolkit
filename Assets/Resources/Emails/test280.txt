is the deck from this morning's team meeting. As always, this is
confidential. Please do not share any slides or details outside SFDC.

As you saw in the team kickoff plans, we have an exciting Q3 ahead of us,
including huge goals for both CRM and Inbox. Additionally, we're
approaching the last stretch before another exciting Dreamforce, led by the
upcoming Einstein announcements. I can’t wait to see what’s coming next for
this truly DTBG team.

And HUGE thanks to Steve for his amazing leadership through this 5 year
journey. We're all looking forward to celebrating today at 4pm @ Casa
Ehikian (411 Lytton Ave, across from the 7/11).

Thanks,
JPaau
