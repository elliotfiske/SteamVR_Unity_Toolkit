________________________________
>
> *Problems Solved:*
>
> Address Properties enables customers to customize their workflow in
> SalesforceIQ by parsing mailing addresses into separate fields within the
> Grid.
>
> For example:
>
>    -
>
>    A salesperson wants to sort all leads in San Francisco in preparation
>    for their upcoming business trip there.
>    -
>
>    A salesperson wants to filter their contacts by city to create
>    geographically personalized mass emails.
>    -
>
>    A sales manager wants to see lead penetration by postal code to assess
>    the health of a particular sales territory.
>
>
> *What’s shipping?*
>
>    -
>
>    Intelligent parsing splits addresses up into city, state/province,
>    country, zip/postal code when a full mailing address is detected.
>    -
>
>    Typeahead helps to auto-populate addresses using the Google Maps API
>    saving time and minimizing error.
>
>
> *Timing:*

>    - Available to employees 8/18
>    - Slow ramp to external users starting 8/24

>    % Parseable Addresses in SalesforceIQ Database
>    -
>
>       Currently only 30% of addresses on contact-based lists and 15% of
>       addresses on account-based lists are eligible to be parsed for V1
>       -
>
>          The majority of our customers only have partial addresses
>          inputted in the 'Address' field today.
>          -
>
>          We expect the % of parseable addresses in our system to grow
>          once Import V2 ships and it becomes possible to concatenate address fields
>          from an XLS into a single mailing address cell
>          -

>    Usage Rate

>    -
>
>    Large number of incomplete/partial addresses in the system due to
>    import UI and previous lack of parsing ability. Only full mailing
>    addresses will be parsed to maintain accuracy; incomplete/partial addresses
>    will not be parsed for V1 (See metrics section above)
