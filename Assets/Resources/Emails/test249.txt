> Hey guys, I’m Andrew (some people call me Grandmasteryang), and I’m a member of the backend CRM team. I just graduated from Northwestern (Go Cats baby), and this is my first full time job! Last summer I interned for Amazon (AWS S3) in Seattle. My family’s from Shanghai, and I’ve lived in Nashville, TN since I was 5 (country music sux). I’m a swimmer, so hit me up if you ever want to go to the pool. I also play sax and am a big jazz fan. Looking forward to meeting the team!
