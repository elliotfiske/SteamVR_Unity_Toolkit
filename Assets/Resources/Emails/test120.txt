Hi All

If you use the iOS SalesforceIQ hockey app, it's currently crashing on
startup, because the iOS Enterprise Certificate expired on the last hockey
app release.

The latest Inbox hockeyapp version now works.  Unfortunately, the Inbox app
crashes before you can see the "Update version" popup that usually
displays, when a new iOS Inbox hockey app is available.

To fix this, you'll need to download the latest iOS SalesforceIQ Inbox
hockeyapp, by opening the iOS Safari browser, and going to

https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/5c87add14b06748916d77e505e17a5ec

If you have any questions, please email me or slack #inbox-questions

Thanks,
Madhav
