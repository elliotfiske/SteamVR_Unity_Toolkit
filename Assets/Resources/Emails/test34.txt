Hi team,

With mixed emotions, today is my last day at SalesforceIQ. I am looking
forward to my next adventure back at Stanford, but will greatly miss
getting to see this team every day. The people here and this journey have
impacted me greatly. Thank you for an incredible journey!!!


*I cannot leave without sharing a few of my favorite #moments *

- Quarterfinalists in the 1st Silicon Valley Sports League

- 2 years of Swim Across America

- 3 Russian River Trips!!!

- Winning Smash Ball Once

- My first demo: RelateIQ flashlight signals

- The Beach Boys & Bruno Mars at Dreamforce! #PardotParty

- Moving from the basement to the sunniest seat in the office ðŸŒ´

- Talking to *now* teammates about their futures at SalesforceIQ - I still
remember where I was for most of those conversations....parking lot,
multiple pools, airport, Russian River, Santa Cruz....

- And, of course, watching this team
