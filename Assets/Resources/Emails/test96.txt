Hi Engineering Team,

We will change Github default permission from Write to None at 5 PM.

*Members will only be able to clone and pull public repositories. To give a
member additional access (eg: write access), weâ€™ll need to add them to
teams or make them collaborators on individual repositories.*

This might impact the permission of existing user. If you have access issue
to Github, please email helpdesk@salesforceiq.com


Thank You and Happy Friday !


Regards,

IT
