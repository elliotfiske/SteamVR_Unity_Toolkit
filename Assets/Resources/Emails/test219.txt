The devastating natural disastersthat have taken place around the globe in recent weeks &ndash; inItaly, Louisiana, and now Indiana &ndash; have saddened us all. These communities, along with many others, can greatly benefit from our assistance. If you would like to get involved, here are a few efforts we are aware of:

In difficult times, we must demonstrate the same care and compassion towards others that we would hope to receive ourselves. Every act of kindness, from donating to volunteering to helping out a coworker who’s having a tough day, will help make the world a better place. My hope is that, no matter where in the world we are, we can find strength in one another and move forward together as one Ohana.

Mahalo,
