*Note: *I have gone through every single bug in our Inbox project and
assigned P1/P2. Some of them are de-prioritized as "Low Priority" which are
moved to "XXX Low Priority" bucket. We have a total of 151 Bugs with
priority( P1- 79, P2 - 72) at this point. Please keep working on fixing
these in upcoming weeks and months. After few months we may have less
number of bugs compared to now.
