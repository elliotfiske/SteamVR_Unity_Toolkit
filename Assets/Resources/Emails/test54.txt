Thanks Robert!

For this release we switched to the ContactsIQ endpoint which only pulls
from image sources that users can edit.

It went to production even faster than we hoped so Roller is going to send
out a release note shortly.  The sources are now:
1) gmail or exchange
2) 3rd party - gravatar.com only

Thanks!
Alex

in all apps where we pull in an image and use ContactIQ instead of the CRM
Person store to get the image data.
