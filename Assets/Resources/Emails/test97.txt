Next steps:
-Make the “Log Event to Salesforce” text more prominent
-Bug: auto suggests number of attendees on Log Event screen, but when you  
click to select the checkboxes are not selected
-Bug: Office365 meeting notes for log event shows HTML, should show  
plaintext

Background - uses other tools:
-linkpoint360 - Best Outlook for Windows application - everything I need to  
move quickly
-cirrus -”its ok” “a few good tools in it” “one of the best email tracking”  
- good for seeing everything you need in your email, not salesforce web

Likes:
-Bottom nav - easy to navigate
-”Calendar is great”

Dislikes:
-On month view show dots for days with events
-Didn’t notice log event

Other comments:
-Inbox Outlook - doesnt honor default browser (hates IE)
-IFT - hard to find output to change duration of meeting
-ContactsIQ: takes up a lot of real estate with someones picture, give more  
Salesforce context
-Thread view has different swipe actions than inbox view
-Bring more Salesforce info into the app so you don’t need to pivot to S1  
(he likes Cirrus iPad app, better than their iPhone app)
