excited to introduce the latest addition to the CRM Design Team, Minh
Nguyen! He sits next to me on the 3rd floor of 124, don't be afraid to come
say hi!

In his own words, here is a bit about Minh:


Hey everyone, my name is Minh. I just started yesterday as the new Visual
Product Designer on the CRM team and I’m stoked! I’m coming from Percolate,
a marketing software company, and before that, SoundHound (you’re probably
more familiar with this company). A few things about me...I'm originally
from Vietnam but lived most of my life in the Bay, I'm kind of a pyromaniac
(as you can see below), and am a pretty decent pool player if I do say so
myself :). So if you're ever interested in a game, let's play! Looking
forward to meeting and getting to know everyone!
