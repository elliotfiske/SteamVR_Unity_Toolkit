Hi Team,

Most of the new furniture pieces have been installed and placed in the
Rainbow Room.  More work will be done in this space next month to complete
the furniture layout.

As a reminder, please keep your feet off the tables/chairs.  We'd like to
keep the new furniture in the best of conditions for as long as possible.
Please don't leave drinks, food, plates, etc. on the side tables around the
furniture by simply cleaning up after yourselves.

Thank you,
-IT/WPS Team
