Hi Team:

Today the Android team released version 2.5.14 of Salesforce Inbox for
Android. This is a bug-fix release that fixes an app crash issue in
creating contact flow, which only affect Android 4.4 devices. Notice that
Android 4.4 is an old version of Android used by less than 4% of our daily
active users.

Thanks,

Evan
