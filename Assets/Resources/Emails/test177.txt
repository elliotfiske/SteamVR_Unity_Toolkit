 Team,

Moving to align with other expense reductions across the company we are
changing our Fraiche policy. From this point on, SalesforceIQ employees can
charge coffee or tea to our company account at Fraiche. Other food and
beverages must be paid for by employees themselves. This change will help
us sustain the perk further.

Also, a small reminder to ensure we can continue to cater meals and snacks
all our employees

   - Snacks are for employees and their guests while at work only. Please
   don't fill up bags for delicious home-time snacking.
   - Meals are for employees and their occasional guests on site.
   - Employees may take food away for themselves, please don't take food
   for others or have guests take food away - until the meal time has ended
   and there are clearly leftovers.

If any of these approaches are unclear please check with me and I will help
clarify.

thanks!
Arthur
