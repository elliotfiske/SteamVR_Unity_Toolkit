Team,

After a long hold while we got Outlook out the door, IQB has finally come
to Chrome-land.

*TL;DR:* from now on, use `iqb start` or `iqb start --staging` to fire up
your development environment

*Long;Read:*

The degulping project that Joe C started for CRM web resulted in the build
tool "iqb". It has since been standardized on bedrock projects, used by all
the fancy new TypeScript components, and Outlook uses it to great effect
for our rapid builds and deploys. Chrome has now also been degulped and
uses iqb to its fullest.

So what do you do now? You can find all the details by reading the docs on
Confluence, reading the README, and using the online help `iqb --help`.
Here is a quick mapping of common `gulp` commands to the new iqb usage:

gulp karma                    iqb test
gulp server                   iqb start
gulp serverStaging            iqb start --staging
gulp serverStagingNoTests     iqb start --staging --no-tests
gulp createServer             iqb serve
gulp createServerStaging      iqb serve --staging

Please be aware that Chrome dev server is now always HTTPS and you must
therefore install and trust a certificate we have created. Instructions are
in the README and linked on Confluence.

Now, go forth and iqb!
