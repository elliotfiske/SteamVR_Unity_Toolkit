Team,

If youâ€™re having issues logging into Aloha and SFDC VPN, there is a
widespread issue with 2FA tokens after an update release of Aloha.  SFDC
engineers are looking to have complete resolution by Monday.  If you really
need to login this weekend, please reach out to us and we can issue a
temporary token.

Thanks,
-IT Team
