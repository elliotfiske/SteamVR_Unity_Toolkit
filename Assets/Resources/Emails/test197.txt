    Indiana Mehta unveiling!!!
Seth Voltz
    The chrome build is finally degulped :D
Steven Yan
    How we deal with windows virtual machines (.... it's a LOT, and Steven
just abstracted it all into a Vagrantfile)
    *bonus*: we can use the VM to run automated tests!
Tom Coyle/Sam Kligman
    Tom's last hurrah was to create some awesome product dashboards for
tracking CRM DAU/WAU/Retention/etc.
Izet Salihbegovic
    SBT: "Salmon Bacon Tomato".......¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    But for real he set up a new build process so canary/rc/prod deploys
run way quicker and more deterministically


*Helmet:* Noah and everyone else who had to deal with CSIRT over the past
week
*Bear:* Everyone in the room for being an amazing team.  Bye Stevo.... :'(
 Thanks for everything!!!!
