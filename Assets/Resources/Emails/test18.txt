*204 Winter ‘17 SB1 Release: 9:30PM PT STATUS*

Summary

   - Progressing as planned. Expecting to sign off on all instances within
   the hour.
   - There's a non-reproducible issue where S1 will fail to load properly
   on a mobile browser on CS21. Because this is not reproducible on other orgs
   in CS21, the App Experience Scrum team will be looking into this to resolve
   it during WAC.
