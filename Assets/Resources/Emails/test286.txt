Apps Team,

Hope everyone is having a great weekend.  A few updates.  On Monday, Alex
Dayon (the President and Chief Product Officer at Salesforce) will be
visiting our office for our 10am team meeting (yes, the meeting has been
moved 15 minutes earlier so please don't be late!).

Additionally, Alex will swing by 117 for a quick update on the Apps team
(Inbox + Graph) around 12:20pm.  I wanted to give everyone a heads up
before I sent a HOLD in your calendars (and I'll provide a hangout).
Please try and attend.  He'll be there for 20 minutes.  And I thought the
best way for Alex to get an update is to see our team in action.  So I was
planning on walking through an abbreviated version of our last Operating
Meeting so he can see the collaboration between Eng, Product, Design and
GTM.    The deck is HERE
<https://docs.google.com/a/salesforce.com/presentation/d/1Kt4cXjO_nJ90pVfMJTX6iL5CiBVoLg2KispIdf2KsxM/edit?usp=sharing>.


Basically, we'll have the same speakers present the same content again (or
feel free to make any updates that you think are relevant for Alex to
see).  You shouldn't have to present any new content.  I will tag each one
of you in the deck to confirm.  Please let me know if you cannot present or
have any questions!

Thank you team, and enjoy the rest of your weekend!
